# C++

## How to run?

The source files are located in `src/dayXX.cpp`.

Use your preferred C++ compiler to compile the day you want. For example:

```sh
g++ src/dayXX.cpp -o bin/dayXX
```

Then run the compiled binary with the name of the input file as argument. E.g.,
if your input is stored in `input/dayXX.txt`:

```sh
./bin/dayXX input/dayXX.txt
```
